Some Hell Knight's sounds might be usable also for Baron and Cacodemon, mainly the projectile sounds. I couldn't find any for the Caco, seriously.

There are sometimes mono and stereo variants for sounds, mostly when a monster can be controlled through a demon rune. ZDoom should handle this automatically (downsampling stereo sounds to mono when played in 3D), so maybe it's useless to have it like this. Whatever. I pretty much did this only with the Revenant before dropping this idea, anyway.

Lost Souls have some sounds in the game's files but afaik only one, completely unrelated at that, is used. I still included them.
